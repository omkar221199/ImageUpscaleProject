This project utilizes two AI based image Upsampling models to upsample images by a scale of  upto 4x. All editing functions are implemented with OpenCV 4.3.0. 
The models used in this project are Enhanced Deep Residual Networks(EDSR) & Fast Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network(FSRCNN). 
The front end part was developed using Streamlit an open source free web framework mainly used in Machine Learning and Data Science projects.
